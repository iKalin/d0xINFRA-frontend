     ;; A valid map value for `synthetic-input` does two things:
     ;; 1) It implicitly marks this component class as an input type so that interactive
     ;;    updates will work without cursor jumping.
     ;; 2) Reagent defers to its functions when it goes to set a value for the input component,
     ;;    or signal a change, providing enough data for us to decide which DOM node is our input
     ;;    node to target and continue processing with that (or any arbitrary behaviour...); and
     ;;    to handle onChange events arbitrarily.
     ;;
     ;;    Note: We can also use an extra hook `on-write` to execute more custom behaviour
     ;;    when Reagent actually writes a new value to the input node, from within `on-update`.
     ;;
     ;;    Note: Both functions receive a `next` argument which represents the next fn to
     ;;    execute in Reagent's processing chain.
